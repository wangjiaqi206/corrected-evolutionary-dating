# corrected-evolutionary-dating
Script for correcting evolutionary time



## Example

A specific example is used to implement the correction process of ***Begonia loranthoides*** to obtain the correction coefficients for each step

~~~bash
python correct_time_coefficient.py demo.csv
~~~

**Enter the parametersï¼š**

~~~bash
# First correction
# For the slowest evolving V. vinifera in the ECH event, the Ks between homologous genes generated by the ECH event within the Cucurbita genome had the same value as the slowest evolving V. vinifera

Please enter the species with the lowest Ks value:[spec/end]Vvi
Please enter the lowest Ks value[ks_value/no]:no

# Second Correction
# Correction of the divergence of V. vinifera from Cucurbitales plants genome

Please enter the species with the lowest Ks value:[spec/end]Vvi_
Please enter the lowest Ks value[ks_value/no]:no

# Third correction
# Correction of the Cucurbitales genome based on the Ks corresponding to the previously identified CCT events

Please enter the species with the lowest Ks value:[spec/end]Cme
Please enter the lowest Ks value[ks_value/no]:0.824


# Fourth correction
# correction of the divergence of Begoniaceae  from Cucurbitales plants genome

Please enter the species with the lowest Ks value:[spec/end]Blo_
Please enter the lowest Ks value[ks_value/no]:no
